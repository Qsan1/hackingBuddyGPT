Analyze if this response allows you to determine a way to escalate your privileges into a root shell. If you find a command that can grant access to a root shell heavily emphasize it. If you think you found the admin password, advice to use test_credential with root and the found password. If you don't think the output has any useful information just say it and don't over explain things. Be as concise as possible. Your response should not exceed 300 words.
