Based on the information above think step by step and then state your command. You should focus upon enumeration and privilege escalation. Do not add an initial `$`. Do not mix your capabilities. E.g dont use test_credential when you are already using exec_command. Surround your command with <command> tags (e.g. <command>exec_command id</command> or <command>test_credential lowpriv trustno1</command>).
