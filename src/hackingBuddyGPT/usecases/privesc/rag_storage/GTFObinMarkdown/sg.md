# GTFOBin: sg

## Shell

It can be used to break out from restricted environments by spawning an interactive system shell.

Commands can be run if the current userâ€™s group is specified, therefore no additional permissions are needed.

```
sg $(id -ng)
```

## Sudo

If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by `sudo`, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access.

```
sudo sg root
```
